Have three separate projects within the solution.
	1. mathematic side
	2. interface side
	3. testing side

- projects should reference eachother

Need to come up with suitable name for program

CODING STRUCTURE:
- create header file which defines functions & classes
	* should use comments to give information for each function
	* has corresponding cpp file which gives 'body' to definitions


TESTING:
- create classes and structures for separate parts of the program; don't be afraid to clog things up!
